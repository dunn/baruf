<h2>What’s <em>Baruffio</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Baruffio</em> is a place for people who think too much about the world of Harry Potter.  We publish criticism, philosophy, fan fiction, conspiracy theories, and just about everything else.</p>

<h2>Submitting to <em>Baruffio</em></h2>

<p>Unfortunately, our budget is like nothing so much as the Weasley's vault in <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train-tracks through the bank’s underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’ vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag.
</blockquote>

<p>That said, we do run ads and will pay contributors a percentage of advertising revenue during the month when their piece is published.</p>

<h3>Content guidelines</h3>
<p>This is a blog about <em>Harry Potter</em>, but basic rules of decency apply.  We will not publish content that promotes:

<ul>
<li>racism,</li>
<li>sexism,</li>
<li>classism,</li>
<li>homophobia,</li>
<li>transphobia,</li>
<li>ableism,</li>
<li>whorephobia, or</li>
<li>any other sort of oppression.</li>
</ul>

This of course does <em>not</em> mean that we don’t encourage you to submit pieces examining issues of oppression and social justice <em>within</em> the world of <em>Harry Potter</em>.
