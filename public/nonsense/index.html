	<h2>About <em>The Daily Nonsense</em></h2>
	<p><em>The Daily Nonsense</em> is the only campus publication at UCSB with any moral compass at all. Upon learning of our existence, a group of campus Republicans went back in time and started something called <a href="http://dailynexus.com/" title="WARNING WARNING FAKE SITE">“The Daily Nexus”</a> in an attempt to undermine our credibility. Support the <em>Nonsense</em> and recognize the <em>Nexus</em> for the cabal of hacks they are!</p>
	<p><em>The Daily Nonsense</em> is a subsidiary of <em><a href="http://localhost:1313/">Santa Barbara Bullshit</a></em>, but has separate <a href="https://twitter.com/thedailynexus">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/thedailynexus">Facebook</a> accounts, as well as a dedicated <a href="http://localhost:1313/nonsense/index.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>
