<p><em>The Bottom Line</em>, the flagship publication of
<a href="drama.html" title="An Unlikely Friendship">our media empire</a>, has a fine
record of <a href="who.html" title="There's No Woman Good
Enough To Play Dr. Who But There Are Strong Female Characters So Shut
It">standing athwart history</a>.  This week that tradition was honored by Madison Donahue-Wolfe,
who steals the Complain-About-Technology crown from
<a href="sexy.html &quot;Stop Making Sense (feat. Ben Moss">Ben Moss</a>&rdquo;) with
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/10/smartphones-how-being-constantly-connected-can-have-deathly-consequences" title="Smartphones: How Being Constantly Connected Can Have Deathly
Consequences">this deep insight</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As technology surges forward, and companies develop more involved
and even wearable products, such as Google Glass, slated for release
sometime in 2014, you must ask yourself whether being so connected
to the web, to your friends, and to your device makes you in turn
more disconnected from the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must, you must, <strong>You Must,</strong> because our sudden immersion in
&ldquo;tech&rdquo;, something that has
<a href="http://punch.photoshelter.com/image/I00006GHuH4c0Ojo">only just now occurred</a>,
leaves us alienated and miserable, as a recent poll discovered:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This report [by Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers] went on to state
that when asked how social and communication activities on
smartphones made them feel, the two most common feelings users
responded with were &ldquo;connected&rdquo; and &ldquo;excited.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are now so &ldquo;connected&rdquo; and &ldquo;excited&rdquo; that we have ceased to sit and
stare at fellow passengers while riding trains, keeping an eye out for
guns and wondering when somebody will get around to inventing the
printing press so we can fucking read a book or something because this
commute feels like forever.</p>
