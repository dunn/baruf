<h1>There&#39;s No Woman Good Enough To Play Dr. Who But There Are Strong Female Characters So Shut It</h1>

<p>The blogosphere let out a collective <em>jolly good</em> earlier this month
upon learning that a white gentleman had been selected to represent
Doctor Who in <em>his</em> eponymous television show.  God continues to save
the Queen.</p>

<p>True devotees of the television event had understandably been rather
worked up in advance of the announcement, for there had been a number
of outrageous rumors and suggestions regarding the nature of the
future Doctor.
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change/comment-page-1#comment-970526">Insufficiently British</a>
commentators had the gall to imagine the venerable man as something
quite unsuitable&mdash;namely, a man of color or, worse, a woman!</p>

<p>Fortunately, cooler (and paler) heads prevailed, and one &ldquo;Peter
Capaldi&rdquo; was selected to carry on the white man&rsquo;s burden of pretending
to be an alien on television.  But even with the question of
&ldquo;diversity&rdquo; settled forever, there are still some who insist on
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/peter-capaldi-is-great-but-its-time-for-a-change" title="Beth Askins: Peter Capaldi Is Great, But It's Time For A Change">picking up pitchforks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Peter Capaldi isn&rsquo;t talented.  I&rsquo;m not saying we
should all riot with pitchforks and torches against the casting
director.  And I&rsquo;m certainly not saying I haven&rsquo;t loved the previous
doctors.  All I&rsquo;m saying is, it&rsquo;s about time for a little change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately,
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/08/should-the-doctor-be-doctored" title="Should the Doctor be Doctored?">Coleman Gray comes out swinging</a> in today&rsquo;s <em>Bottom Line</em> against
this outrageous attempt to undermine one of the last opportunities for
white male employment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The recent Doctors of Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith have all been
excellent actors, and I would like to think that all future
regenerations will feature similarly talented actors chosen based on
performance alone.  Even though the casting of a female or racially
diverse Doctor might be appreciated by some, I would be just as
excited and apprehensive as I am over the casting of any other new
replacement actor.  But, if they were to cast an individual because
of the grumblings of an upset minority and not because of acting
talent, it would be a mistake.  After all, as a creature nearly a
millennium old and bouncing about the utter limits of both time and
space, the Doctor should be above current political and social
trends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Gray admits that &ldquo;there are many strong female and racially
diverse characters&rdquo; in the series, but points out that while female
and racially diverse actors do a good enough job in supporting roles,
they just aren&rsquo;t as good as white men.  The choice of a woman and/or
person of color to play Doctor Who would be a politicized choice,
biased by current social trends, in a way that the selection of a
white man is not.  Decades from now, we will look back and laugh at
the idea that a creature nearly a millennium old and bouncing about
the utter limits of both time and space could ever be accurately
portrayed by anyone but a white man from a small island in the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>Because trends come and go, but white men are forever.</p>
