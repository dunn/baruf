<p>Santa Barbara is full of Serious People with Serious Problems. If they aren’t heroically defending the city’s Mediterranean architecture, or battling against City Council’s perpetual War on Cars, they are fretting about the lack of civility shown by today’s youths and marvelling at the impudence of the homeless population’s continued existence.</p>

<h2><a href="http://localhost:1313/shit/magic">Is It Possible To Be Other Than A Walking Stereotype?</a></h2>
</header>
<p><a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/is-there-a-glass-that-is-neither-half-full-nor-half-empty653636/">It is an expression we have all heard</a>,
someone is either &ldquo;a glass half full … or glass half empty&rdquo; kind of
person. It is a not question of perception, philosophy or sheer
determination to decide how you want to perceive the world.  This is
not an interesting concept either since it&rsquo;s an expression and not a
concept at all.</p>

<p><strong>I would like to introduce a perception,</strong> which is different than
the expressions and concepts previously introduced on account of it
being a perception and not an expression or a concept.</p>

<p>If you are feeling too negative, and the &ldquo;glass&rdquo; is always half empty
for you … pour it out. Literally stop being negative.</p>

<p>Sounds unachievable perhaps, and you might think this article is published on <em>Santa Barbara Bullshit</em> for a reason, but I have
a book for you that is way worse.</p>

<p>Our local author, Rhonda Byrne (relation to
<a href="http://localhost:1313/shit/liberal">Sharon Byrne</a> unknown) has written several books, The
Magic is one that shifted much of my perception on how to write
grammatically.</p>

<p>While reading The Magic, <strong>I discovered a simple directive.
Gratitude.</strong> Yes, it can be an actual verb, despite being a concept
and not a word at all.</p>

<p>You can do actual scientific experiments with this concept, like
discovering a causal relationship between
<a href="http://megr.im/post/lucidity">New Age nonsense and cultural appropriation</a>.
There is even a science known as Spiritual Physics, assuming that
&ldquo;science&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>science</em> and &ldquo;physics&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>physics</em>.</p>

<p>I could end with a quote from Einstein about human stupidity, but ugh
why bother.</p>

<h2><a href="http://localhost:1313/nonsense/tenure">Blame Canada! (Because They’re Socialists, So They Might As Well Be Communists, Which Is Apparently What Tenured Professors Are)</a></h2>
</header>
<p>As an admirer of fine dissimulation, it was with great pride that I
read Brett Debbold&rsquo;s
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2014/01/teacher-tenure-only-good-in-theory" title="Teacher Tenure: Only Good in Theory">recent piece on tenure</a> in the <em>Bottom Line</em>.  With
such young prodigies (or should we say
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/01/better-than-ezra" title="Better
then Ezra"><em>wunderkinder</em></a>&rdquo;), we need not worry about the advancing age of some of
our current <a href="http://sbshit.com/wage.html" title="What Is The
Point Of A Living Wage If We Are Not Truly Alive">sleeper agents</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Debbold&rsquo;s
<a href="http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2014/01/teacher-tenure-only-good-in-theory" title="Teacher Tenure: Only Good in Theory">article</a>, titled &ldquo;Teacher Tenure: Only
Good in Theory&rdquo;, is, of course, actually a cleverly-disguised attack
on the underlying logic of capitalism.  That&rsquo;s something Harris
Sherline already did very well, but the angle of tenured employment is
new, so we will forgive Brett.  And his piece itself is admirably
straightforward, setting up the dialectic in the very first sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tenure, much like communism, is a good idea in theory, but its
modern application does more harm than good for teachers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we&rsquo;re using the standard John Birch Model, then communism is on the
opposite end of the economic freedom spectrum from capitalism.  By
comparing tenure to capitalism, we are to understand it as
antithetical to the principles of capitalism.  The existence of tenure
will necessarily be precarious in a capitalistic system, as Mr. Debbold
points out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal of tenure is to protect proven teachers from dismissal when
new administrations or young teachers come into their schools
[or they express controversial opinions in their classrooms; or they criticize the existing administration; or they speak out against racism, sexism, or other sorts of discrimination; or they come out as gay, lesbian, transgender, etc.; or they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/us/anita-hill-plans-to-leave-teaching-post-in-oklahoma.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">find themselves in a political firestorm</a>].
The fear is that without tenure, older teachers will be unjustly
pushed out in order to save the school money or because of
conflicting teaching theory
[or because they express controversial opinions in their classrooms; or because they criticize the existing administration; or because they speak out against racism, sexism, or other sorts of discrimination; or because they come out as gay, lesbian, transgender, etc.; or because they find themselves in a political firestorm].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having established so clearly the great value of tenure, Mr. Debbold&rsquo;s
rhetorical strategy is to lay forth the common arguments against
tenure and simply allow the reader to see how ludicrous they are in
the light of what has already been said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the most part, the teachers who would deserve to keep their jobs
would do so easily even without tenure. Just like in any other
profession, there is no reason for an administration to fire good
employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly, no reason at all!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tenure does, however, give license to those who have earned it to
become complacent in their work. Of course not every tenured teacher
lets his or her work decline, but it is an easy course to
take. Knowing that you can’t be fired for anything less than a
serious offense is a dangerous thing. The fear of getting fired and
the desire to get promoted are the most common incentives for good
work, and with tenure, many teachers are left without either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an anecdotal aside, 100% of my fellow graduate students have
actually informed me that they&rsquo;re dedicating the majority of their
twenties to become experts in a field they are truly passionate about
just so they can play Candy Crush a lot when they get tenure.  But
like
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Emp" title="SEP: Hume: Empiricism">Hume&rsquo;s missing shade of blue</a>, I don&rsquo;t think this data point should be
given much weight.  In any case, here is the heart of Brett&rsquo;s essay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worse than that, tenure forces schools to fire superior teachers for
the sole reason that they haven’t been around as long as their
peers. When merit is no longer the basis for which firings are
decided, something is wrong with the system. When schools inevitably
undergo cutbacks and inferior teachers remain employed while young
teachers excited to go to work are let go, tenure is to blame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They key word here is &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;.  In a capitalist society, the
expansion of higher education following World War Two was in fact an
anomaly, and the current funding cuts, privatization, and rise of the
adjunct labor class should be seen as the more natural phenomena.
Anyone feeling mystified as to why our government is not even
considering straightforward and relatively inexpensive reforms that
would make education
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/" title="Here's Exactly How Much the Government Would Have to Spend to Make
Public College Tuition-Free">truly free for all</a> does not fully appreciate the economic
and political pressures, created by capitalism, that rule out this
obvious solution.  Likewise, the sensible job protections offered by
tenure are anathema to capitalism, and so have been strategically
associated with lazy, overpaid, unqualified professors.</p>

<p>As if to drive home the absurdity of this last charge, Brett Debbold
ends with a comparison of tenured teachers with Supreme Court
Justices:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teaching is a far cry from the Supreme Court, where job security is
necessary to ensure job performance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was, of course, a certain member of that judicial body whose sexual
harassment created the aforementioned political firestorm around
<em>tenured professor</em> Anita Hill, who was saved from retaliatory
termination of her employment due to her tenure.</p>

<p>A far cry, indeed.</p>

<h2><a href="http://localhost:1313/shit/war">You Don’t Need a Time Traveler to Stop the Culture War From Ever Having Happened</a></h2>
</header>
<blockquote>
<p>Metaphors exert a powerful influence on our thought, by leading us
to draw connections that would have otherwise lain undiscovered.
Their power is great, and so they must be used wisely.</p>

<p>&mdash; Someone really wise and shit, maybe a centaur</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One metaphor that&rsquo;s everywhere these days, or at least close enough to
everywhere to justify a thinkpiece about it, is the metaphor of <em>war</em>.
Everyone seems to be comparing war with things that are not war, but
which they are pretty sure are still a lot like war.  Some of these
comparisons are good, maybe, like the description of a widespread
effort to undermine access to life-saving reproductive health
resources as a &ldquo;War on Women&rdquo;; others are probably
<a href="http://wonkette.com/490754/catch-1123-being-a-true-and-accurate-account-of-the-late-war-on-christmas" title="Wonkette: Catch-11/23: Being A True and Accurate Account of the Late
War On Christmas">bad</a>.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s got to be some truth in our favorite longest-running
metaphorical war, right?  If <strong>Culture War</strong> isn&rsquo;t real then all the
weaponized irony we&rsquo;ve deployed will have been for nothing and <em>SBBS</em>
might as well shut down.  So we&rsquo;re really mad about Jeffrey Moualim&rsquo;s
new piece in the <em>Independent</em>, which
<a href="http://www.independent.com/news/2014/jan/19/cease-fire-anyone/" title="Cease Fire, Anyone?">shows some deep disanalogies</a> between actual war and whatever I&rsquo;ve been doing
as a foot soldier in the &ldquo;U.S. Right-Left Culture War&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even with the incredibly fierce fighting that transpired for most of
[World War I&rsquo;s] four years, on Christmas, both sides would observe a
cease fire. Men would put down their guns, the sound of canons would
go silent, and some would actually venture into no man&rsquo;s land and
fraternize with the enemy. In the midst of sheer madness, there was
a glimpse, if for just for a moment, of sanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My initial reaction was that I <em>can</em> identify with this, since I
sometimes have to stop making fun of bronies because they have Magic
cards I want to trade for.</p>

<p>But then Mr. Moualim describes the &ldquo;Culture War&rdquo; in similarly
militaristic terms and takes the comparison to its logical and absurd
conclusion, threatening our business for no better reason than to
establish an important truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today there is a war waged every day, a culture war between the left
and the right. It is timeless and it appears endless. It uses media
of every kind to blitzkrieg the opposition, and those left standing
are entranced with the idea &ldquo;we live to fight again.&rdquo; The notion of
peace is nonnegotiable, and compromise is considered surrender. The
right and left of this country will do battle, and hostilities do
not stop even for the most important and significant day of the year
during which believers espouse peace on earth, good will toward
men. One need only turn on the television or access the Internet to
see polarizing figures like Miley Cyrus or Phil Robertson of <em>Duck
Dynasty</em> lobbing shells of extremism at the other side, a shock and
awe strategy intended to evoke harsh and bitter feelings from the
&ldquo;enemy&rdquo; and provoke a response filled with hate and hysteria. And
while it may seem to some just harmless fencing, it has in point of
fact caused deep divisions in this country, where walls of
intolerance are fortified instead of torn down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as it pains me to admit this, I believe Mr. Moualim is correct
in the conclusions he draws from this juxtaposition, which are
definitely these conclusions and not other conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wars might be sometimes fought for reasons other than the immediate
interests of those actually fighting in them.  The soldiers who did
that illicit fraternizing in no-man&rsquo;s-land on Christmas 1914 didn&rsquo;t
really have reasons to hate those on the other side, except when
this one German guy cheated during a game of Magic.  But the
higher-level officers were pretty ticked off about this because
their interests were closer aligned with the state.  The foot
soldiers and their &ldquo;recognition of each other&rsquo;s humanity&rdquo; were
fucking up the game-plan.</p>

<p>As our good Mr. Moualim makes clear, though, the &ldquo;issues&rdquo; commonly
associated with the &ldquo;Culture War&rdquo;&mdash;the rights of women, people of
color, and sexual, gender, and romantic minorities; gun control
and justice system reform; climate change and other aspects of
environmental justice&mdash;are not abstract concerns that matter only
to guys like Hitler.  They directly concern the lives of our
friends and families (it&rsquo;s a bit of a hassle) and those who oppose
us&mdash;who will actually work to prevent free reproductive care for
all, or the end of the drug war&mdash;are threatening our interests
profoundly.  They&rsquo;re trying to cheat at a <em>lot</em> of games of Magic,
and they won&rsquo;t recognize the humanity of all of us.  Effed up.</p></li>

<li><p>The second point that Mr. Moualim definitely makes at some point in
his essay, I mean unless I <em>really</em> misread it, is that the
<em>objectives</em> of the &ldquo;Culture War&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t that much like the objectives
of a real war at all.  If there are any overarching goals shared
between all the ongoing struggles on behalf of marginalized people,
one is probably to secure the universal recognition of their
humanity&mdash;to make a Christmas Armistice <em>possible</em> between more than
just white men from different European countries.</p>

<p>And an armistice was not probably the point of the Great War, or
of any war, and anyway if all you want is an armistice you
probably want fewer soldiers rather than more of them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So Jeffrey Moualim answers the rhetorical question in his article&rsquo;s
title: it makes no sense to call for a cease-fire, for an armistice,
in the &ldquo;Culture War&rdquo;, not only because it&rsquo;s not a real war but
because, when we do get a cease-fire, it means we&rsquo;ve <em>won</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://localhost:1313/nonsense/obama">The Strawman That Broke The Camel’s Back</a></h2>
</header>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I love apps. I have downloaded so, so many of them.&rdquo; &mdash;
<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229576" title="Forget Constant Communication, This App Offers Instant Communication">Kyle Richey, Millennial</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Millennials love apps.  We make Tweets, we Tumbl, and Snap Chat with
each other all day long.  We also love President Obama.  Like,
<a href="http://wonkette.com/498120/why-spend-17-95-on-erotic-obama-fan-fic-when-you-can-get-your-cow-for-free" title="Why Spend $17.95 On 'Erotic' Obama Fan-Fic, When You Can Get Your Cow
At Wonket For Free?">a lot</a>.  So we were very excited when we learned that
Obama was making an <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">app</a>.  An app made
by Obama would be the combination of the two things we love &mdash; Obama
and apps.</p>

<p>But Obama did not make a good app.  His app is not the next Snap Chat.
It is not snappy.  It is bad.  Obama&rsquo;s bad app has left us Millennials
feeling betrayed and very sad.
<a href="http://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/breaking-the-second-term-curse/" title="Breaking the Second Term Curse">And angry</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to avoid this topic, I did.  But I can only sit around for
so long while Jon Stewart, NPR and the New York Times &mdash; basically
all of my closest friends &mdash; tear one of my biggest heroes apart.
This has been heartbreaking for me.  And for all of the times that I
have blindly supported Obama, though I will never admit to actually
ever being false, today I cannot ignore our president&rsquo;s decisions
simply because I am really inspired by Michelle Obama&rsquo;s gnarly
biceps and triceps.  Today is the day I never expected to see.
Today I will critique the actions of President Barack Obama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These words are coming from a Millennial, so they should concern
President Obama.  Especially because even though this Millennial is
writing under the name &ldquo;Mckinley Krongaus&rdquo; she is probably
actually <a href="http://youtu.be/o6G3nwhPuR4">Lena Dunham</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am debatably President Obama&rsquo;s biggest fan.  I am constantly
tweeting inappropriate fantasies of wishing to bear his children and
quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t know why the National Security Agency hasn&rsquo;t
checked up on me yet.  The newspaper cover from that heavenly day in
November 2008 remains tacked on my closet door at home and I will
forever remember the incredible feeling I had as I gave up my voting
virginity for him aside a stripper pole at the lovely AEPi house.
But holy shit, is he dicking around right now, or what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One reason why Millennials are not happy about Obama&rsquo;s app is that a
cool feature was removed that we really wanted.
<a href="http://wonkette.com/532898/obamas-you-can-keep-your-plan-failed-to-anticipate-how-much-americans-love-cheap-crappy-plans-that-cover-nothing" title="Obama’s 'You Can Keep Your Plan' Failed To Anticipate How Much
Americans Love Cheap Crappy Plans That Cover Nothing">We wanted to be able to be fucked over by insurance companies</a>, and Obama&rsquo;s
app doesn&rsquo;t let us do that (no wait it was just
<a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/11/obamacare-keep-your-insurance-plan">updated</a>,
we&rsquo;re all good).</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not the only reason we Millennials are mad.  We&rsquo;re also mad
because the Obama app is not a good app:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On my bike ride to class yesterday morning I was listening to NPR&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Morning Edition&rdquo; (yes, I&rsquo;m that person) and heard a ridiculous
story about these three guys in the Silicon Valley who were fed up
with the terrible setup of the healthcare website and sat down and
literally made their own.  It&rsquo;s called healthsherpa.com and so far
it&rsquo;s helped to provide thousands of users with insurance quotes that
they couldn&rsquo;t get access to on the actual Affordable Care Act
website.  One of the programmers said that about 85 percent of their
website&rsquo;s users have been able to complete the process of finding a
plan that works for them compared to the humorously praised number
of 100,000 Americans that have chosen plans on the real website.
Reality check: There are 40 million uninsured Americans and we&rsquo;re
pretending to be stoked on 100,000 being able to even make their way
through the website all the way? The moral of the story was that
three dudes under the age of 30 created a website that is more
functional than the website brain-child of the entire federal
government. That&rsquo;s a little silly, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lena Dunham is a Millennial, so she
<a href="https://medium.com/funny-stuff/d7e5d14065f1" title="Dear
Miss Disruption">learned to code</a> and knows some things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Move fast and break things</p></li>

<li><p>Always be shipping</p></li>

<li><p>Disrupt the industry</p></li>

<li><p>Innovation</p></li>

<li><p>Pivot</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Entrepreneur&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Horse_ebooks</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obama&rsquo;s app did not break things.  Obama&rsquo;s app is broken.  It&rsquo;s not
the same thing, and Obama&rsquo;s app is the bad one.  Also it did not move
fast.  Obama&rsquo;s app is slow.  The Health Sherpa is a good app because
it was made by Millennial.  It also has vision.
<a href="http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/11/11/why-healthsherpa-com-is-not-a-replacement-for-healthcare-gov/">It does one thing</a>
and does it well.  Obama&rsquo;s app tries to do too many things, like sell
people health insurance.  That&rsquo;s bad.  The Health Sherpa worked for 85
percent of its users.  Obama&rsquo;s app only worked for 100,000.</p>

<p>100,000 is less than 85 percent.  That&rsquo;s bad for Obama and his app.</p>

<p>Obama&rsquo;s app
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/10/why-the-healthcaregov-train-wreck-happened-in-slow-motion.html" title="Healthcare.gov: It Could Be Worse">could not have been worse</a>.
It&rsquo;s as bad as the hurricane that
<a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/Things_That_Are_Not_Like_Each_Other" title="Nobody Drowned From Obamacare">killed a lot of people</a>.  Obama&rsquo;s app might be killing people
too, maybe:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>obamacare is a fuckin trainwreck. kids with cancer don&#39;t even want insurance now. &quot;the website is bad,&quot; they said, dying. &quot;its too slow&quot;</p>&mdash; beefy tee (@BronzeHammer) <a href="https://twitter.com/BronzeHammer/statuses/391548402997407744">October 19, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Thanks, Obama.</p>

<h2><a href="http://localhost:1313/shit/facts">Facts Are Good. Feelings Are Better.</a></h2>
</header>
<p>Santa Barbara&rsquo;s a small town, but there&rsquo;s always room for another
pundit.  Indeed, we have quite an enviable concentration of writers
willing to bullshit (in the
<a href="http://philosophynow.org/issues/53/On_Bullshit_by_Harry_Frankfurt" title="*On Bullshit* by Harry Frankfurt">technical sense</a>) in our local publications.  If
Sharon Byrne is our city&rsquo;s Thomas Friedman, putting forth an
<a href="liberal.html" title="A New Argument for Moral
Relativism">incoherent pragmatism</a> divorced from truth or morality as a solution to our
political conflicts, then Cheri Rae is our very own David Brooks and
Craig Allen is
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+enderle">Rob Enderle</a>.</p>

<p>Rae and Allen both have written recent columns that are admirable in
their pursuit of
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm">truthiness</a>.  Rae&rsquo;s
column is
<a href="http://www.santabarbaraview.com/drive-they-say653663/" title="Drive! They Say.">a lovely wistful meditation</a> on the necessity of cars.  She mocks the idea that
we should promote alternative modes of transportation with this chunk
of hard data:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the 16th birthday dawns, it&rsquo;s finally time to earn the Golden
Ticket to Freedom and Adulthood: the Driver&rsquo;s License. Some, as my
own son did, make their appointments for the first moment of the
first day they can officially take the driving test.  Others, like
my own daughter wait a year or two, but the idea of not
driving&mdash;ever, or rarely&mdash;never enters their minds at all.</p>

<p>Truth is, driving is high up there on the list of teen essentials,
along with smartphones, texting and hanging out.  Just take a look
at the completely packed student parking lots at our local high
schools&mdash;and the fine luxury cars so many kids are driving from
home to school and all over town.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could counter with nostalgic anecdotes of my own, telling the unique
life histories of my several friends in their 20s who have yet to get
a license, but I&rsquo;m bored and I found this by typing &ldquo;decline in teen
driving&rdquo; into Google and clicking the first result:</p>

</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to Craig Allen, who wrote
<a href="http://www.noozhawk.com/article/craig_allen_apple_computers_20131027" title="Craig Allen: Apple at Risk of Becoming an 'Also-Ran'">an equally ignorant and ahistorical thinkpiece</a> on Apple&rsquo;s
prospects.  He starts with a complaint so deep and important that it
has been uttered by every Wordpress blogger since late 2011: that &ldquo;in
the time since Jobs died, Apple has released numerous evolutionary
products&mdash;new versions of the iPhone and iPad, but has not released
any truly new, revolutionary products to rival its current lineup.&rdquo;
This insight derives its force from the scientific principle that
since the three &ldquo;revolutionary products&rdquo; usually recognized by
pundits&mdash;the iPod, iPhone and iPad&mdash;debuted in 2001, 2007, and 2010,
the next revolution should surely have occurred sometime in 2011 or
2012, even though Jobs has only recently ceased to be the subject of
<a href="http://maypalo.com/2011/10/09/top-5-best-steve-jobs-in-heaven-comics/">shitty cartoons set in Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>Allen can be forgiven for overlooking
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html" title="This is how Apple rolls">the arcane scholastic doctrine of &ldquo;incrementalism&rdquo;</a> that some Medieval theorists believed
better explains Apple&rsquo;s history.  It is a much more complicated thesis
than the one Allen and most of his contemporaries rely on, which is
the single word &ldquo;INNOVATION&rdquo; written in 72pt Impact font.</p>

<p>Allen is correct, however, to bemoan the apparently
increasingly-desperate efforts to fool investors into valuing Apple
highly.
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/28/5039154/apple-q4-2013-earnings">Pitiful revenues last quarter</a>
and increasingly dismal
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/business/media/apple-passes-coca-cola-as-most-valuable-brand.html?_r=0">brand recognition</a>
support his assertion that &ldquo;Apple&rsquo;s management team must produce real
revenue growth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He is also correct to compare Apple to another dedicated cellphone
manufacturer that failed when its only product was made obsolete:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As great as Apple has been, its trajectory is similar to many other
companies that were once high-fliers and eventually
tanked. BlackBerry is probably the best example. Not too long ago,
Blackberry had a cult-like following, so much so that people
referred to the device as a &ldquo;crackberry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The analogy here is very good; neither Apple nor RIM are willing to
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/blackberry_vs_iphone">cannibalize their own marketshare by coming out with better stuff</a>
and then diligently improving it.  Allen&rsquo;s closing statement is
therefore deeply troubling:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The market is sending a clear signal that Apple is in its twilight
as a major market leader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not for the reason he thinks.</p>
