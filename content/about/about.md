Submitting to *Baruffio*
------------------------

Unfortunately, our budget is like nothing so much as the Weasley's vault
in *Chamber of Secrets*:

> The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that
> sped along miniature train-tracks through the bank's underground
> tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys'
> vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley,
> when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles
> inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs Weasley felt right into the
> corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag.

That said, we do run ads and will pay contributors a percentage of
advertising revenue during the month when their piece is published.
