}

In *Harry Potter*, places like Hogwarts are hidden from unwelcome eyes
with a number of protective enchantments.  One of these enchantments
makes the building *unplottable*, and so---apparently---incapable
of being plotted on a map.

It's not immediately obvious how this is possible.  Some of the
simpler and more obvious proposals as to how Unplottability might work
turn out to be no good.  Unplottability cannot not say anything about
what I can and can't draw on a piece of paper.  It's possible with
magic to prevent the information from being *transmitted,* but this
won't be enough to prevent us from using maps to find Hogwarts.

What *does* work is something more drastic: Unplottability has to
prevent us from *inferring* the location of a place from other
information.  The benefit of this radical solution is that it
preserves the spirit of Unplottability, which is to prevent people
from figuring out *where Hogwarts is.*

I'm not really sure how disguising Hogwarts as a ruin will keep out
Muggle archaeologists, but that's beside the point.  Just what on
earth does it *mean* for something to be Unplottable?  (The text is
silent on whether Hogwarts itself is Unplottable, but
[Durmstrang is](http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/harry-potter/if-hogwarts-castle-is-unplottable/t.13491169_15/#15
"\"If Hogwarts castle is unplottable...\" at Gaia Online"), so
it's likely that Hogwarts is as well.)

## I can draw a map and write "Hogwarts" on it

Above I said that Unplottability can't say anything about what I can
or can't draw on a piece of paper.  More precisely, there's no way to
stop me from encoding certain information on a map.  But why not?

Let's look at how someone might try to prevent us from encoding that
sort of information.  Whatever they do, I don't think they'll manage
it:

1. Suppose a witch or wizard managed to cast an enchantment that had
   the following effect: whenever someone writes "Hogwarts" (or
   something sufficiently similar) at roughly the point where Hogwarts
   is located on a map, the enchantment erases what you've written.
   This obviously isn't good enough, because you could refer to
   Hogwarts using a different name.  This is a ban on *using
   "Hogwarts" to refer to Hogwarts*.  It is not a ban on plotting
   Hogwarts on a map.  If I am trying to make you a map with Hogwarts
   on it, I could tell you "I will write 'Pigfarts' instead of
   'Hogwarts'", and then when I write "Pigfarts", I am plotting
   Hogwarts on the map.

    A second problem with this approach is that if the enchantment
    only detects when I've written "Hogwarts", my writing will be
    visible until I finish that string of letters.  If you are
    watching over my shoulder as I work, you will see me get at least
    as far as "Hogwart" and will probably infer my intention (to plot
    Hogwarts on this map), and the enchantment will be foiled.  In
    order to work, the enchantment would have to determine our
    *intentions* and act before we can even start writing.

    The subject of *intention* brings us to a second possible method
    to make it impossible to encode information about a place's
    location.

2. Suppose it's possible, somehow, to determine when I'm *intending*
   to plot Hogwarts on a map.  Maybe an enchantment could figure out
   when I'm thinking about Hogwarts in a certain way while mapmaking,
   or whatever.  When this happens, the enchantment makes me forget
   what I'm doing, or triggers something like the Tongue-Tying Curse
   except for writing, or in some other way prevents me from
   fulfilling my intention to plot Hogwarts on a map.  Why wouldn't
   this work?

    This wouldn't work because it's possible for someone to make
    something that *functions* as a map showing the location of
    Hogwarts without intending to.  Suppose a Muggle child is drawing
    fake maps for fun and *accidentally* draws one with a castle in
    just the right place on an accurate representation of the Scottish
    highlands.  It's even possible that---by a massive
    coincidence---the child could decide to label this castle
    "Hogwarts".

    Now, while there's definitely a sense in which this Muggle child
    hasn't really plotted Hogwarts on a map, the following scenario
    could still occur, if this is all Unplottability amounts to: the
    child drops their map while leaving King's Cross, and it is picked
    up by a witch or wizard, who has been seeking the location of
    Hogwarts.  They assume that someone plotted Hogwarts on a map and
    then dropped it.  They guide themselves using this map, and as a
    result arrive at Hogwarts.

Our first solution was obviously insufficient, in part because it
failed to account for a mapmaker's intention.  But in our examination
of the second solution, we can see that accounting for the mapmaker's
intention won't work either.  Our scenario, involving the child
serendipitously writing "Hogwarts" in exactly the right place on a map
of the Scottish highlands, might be a scenario in which it's *strictly
false* that Hogwarts was plotted on a map, but the spirit of the idea
has clearly been violated.  The *point* of unplottability is to keep
people from *using* maps to locate Hogwarts.

So we should look next at how a witch or wizard would *use* a map to
find Hogwarts.

## But I can't use that map to find Hogwarts

The crucial detail of our scenario above was that the witch or wizard
who finds the child's map *assumes* that the author *intended* to plot
Hogwarts on their map.  They believe---incorrectly, in this
case---that the map was written with a *communicative intention*.  The
witch or wizard believes---again incorrectly---that they *recognize
the communicative intention* of the author, which is to communicate to
the reader the location of Hogwarts.

Suppose our witch or wizard had not made this mistake.  Suppose they
overheard the Muggle child taking about the map before dropping it,
and realized that it was pure coincidence that led the child to label
a map with "Hogwarts".  If the witch or wizard nonetheless picked up
the map, they would not mistake it for a map showing the location of
Hogwarts because they would *not* take themselves to recognize the
author's communicative intention.  They would not think that the map
was written with a communicative intent.  They would not learn
anything from the map because they wouldn't imagine that there is
anything to learn.  Information transmission of this sort requires the
belief in a communicative intention, and when this is missing it will
not occur.

If this was how Unplottability works, even if a witch or wizard finds
a map on which Hogwarts *has* been plotted, the effect of
Unplottability would be to block the recognition of the mapmaker's
communicative intention.  The reader would *not* believe that they are
reading a map showing the location of Hogwarts, but will instead be in
a situation similar to the witch or wizard who knows that they are
looking at the scrawlings of a Muggle child.

This kind of unplottability would play out in strange ways.  If I
plotted a map of Hogwarts, then pushed it across the table at you,
saying "Look!  I plotted Hogwarts on this map; you can use it to learn
its location", you would somehow nonetheless fail to recognize the
communicative intention of the map.  You might suppose that I
*believe* I have plotted Hogwarts but haven't, or that I am only
*pretending* to plot a map, like the Muggle child.

It's hard to imagine what it would be like to experience this
situation, but that's no objection to the theory: it's magic.

The problem is that there *is* an objection to this theory (which was
brought to my attention by [@helenoftroyius](https://twitter.com/helenoftroyius)).

## The Marauder's Map

The Marauder's Map is a "internal" map of Hogwarts, so it doesn't,
strictly speaking, show the location of the castle.  But since it
shows the secret passages leading to Hogsmeade, it's possible to
figure out where Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are in relation to each other.
Hogsmeade is almost certainly plottable, so using the Marauder's Map
to learn the location of Hogsmeade is unproblematic.  But *because*
Hogsmeade is plottable, we can easily find it on a map, and
therefore---because we used the Map to find the relative location of
Hogwarts---locate Hogwarts.  We're using maps only to find plottable
locations, but by learning of the location of Hogsmeade *relative to
Hogwarts*, this process allows us to bypass Hogwarts' unplottability.

Now you might be thinking that this loophole probably only affects
Hogwarts, because no other unplottable locations have (a)
comprehensive internal maps and (b) passages leading out towards
plottable locations.  So who cares, right?

But things are actually much much worse than this.  We can learn the
location of Hogwarts relative to Hogsmeade by using the Marauder's
Map, but we can also figure it out by *walking there*.  The Map isn't
actually the problem.  I can just as easily walk from Durmstrang to
the first plottable village.  *Boom*, I know where Durmstrang is.

So Unplottability can't just consist in preventing me from recognizing
a communicative intention.  It has to be something more, if it's going
to work.

## "*A*, and if *A*, then *B*, therefore ... what?"

An [earlier version](http://baruffio.com/docs/unplottable.html) of this
essay concluded that Unplottability was impossible.  Jacob T. Levy,
Tomlinson Professor of Political Theory at McGill University, found
that pessimism unwarranted and proposed a solution:

An S.E.P., or Somebody Else's Problem, field,
"[utilizes a person's natural tendency to ignore things they don't easily accept](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Somebody_Else's_Problem_field
"Hitchhiker Wiki")" by causing them to simply *ignore* certain
information:

> Any object around which a S.E.P. [field] is applied will cease to be

This proposal raises difficult and delicate questions in the
philosophy of mind that I don't know how to answer.  But it also
suggests an even simpler solution: whenever I try to infer *from* some
pieces of information *to* the location of Hogwarts, the
Unplottability enchantment blocks that inference.

When I walk from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade, measuring the distance, I may
end up with this bit of knowledge:

1. I walked 1km, northwest, from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade.

It may not be obvious at first, but just knowing that does *not* mean
that one automatically knows this:

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Hogwarts is 1km southeast of Hogsmeade.</li>
</ol>

I can *infer* (2) from (1), but I have to know some other things as
well.  Things like:

<ol type="i">
<li><p>If I walk a certain distance from point <em>A</em> to point <em>B</em>, <em>A</em> is that far from <em>B</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <em>A</em> is a certain distance from <em>B</em>, then <em>B</em> is the same distance from <em>A</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <em>B</em> is northwest of <em>A</em>, then <em>A</em> is southeast of <em>B</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

Of course all these things are *obvious*, so we don't usually think
about how we rely on them for drawing equally obvious conclusions like
(2).  But we do rely on them, and we also rely on *inference rules*
that allow us to move from our premises to our conclusion.  For
example, just to conclude that Hogwarts is 1km from Hogsmeade, I have
to reason like this:

- I walked 1km from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade

- If I walked 1km from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade, Hogwarts is 1km from Hogsmeade.

- *Therefore*, Hogwarts is 1km from Hogsmeade.

"Therefore" marks the point at which I make an inference.  If I
somehow fail to see that there is a valid inference to be made, I may
be left with only the first two pieces of information, not knowing
whether Hogwarts is 1km from Hogsmeade or not.

This, I suggest, is exactly the situation I will be in, because the
Unplottability enchantment will prevent me from making inferences
that would allow me to learn the location of Hogwarts.  I will be like
[Lewis Carroll's Tortoise](http://alexdunn.info/docs/carroll1895.pdf
"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles"), except unable---rather than
simply unwilling---to see that if *A* is true, and *A then B* is
true, that *B* must be true as well.

Thus, even if I know where Hogsmeade is, *and* know that I have to
walk 1km from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade, because Hogwarts is Unplottable I
*cannot* use this information to determine where Hogwarts is, because
I simply fail to make the simple but necessary inferences.  Likewise,
after their adventure in the flying Ford Anglia in *Chamber of
Secrets,* Harry and Ron might know both where King's Cross Station is
and how far they traveled to get to Hogwarts, but Unplottability
prevents them from thereby deducing where Hogwarts is.

****

There's no reason to think that this enchantment could only prevent
inferences from map-based information; it would hardly honor the
spirit of the spell to suppose that if I had learn where Hogsmeade is
without using a map, that I could then determine the location of
Hogwarts.  If the purpose of Unplottability is to keep the location of
a place secret, then a blanket ban on the sorts of inferences that
would betray that secret seems entirely plausible.
