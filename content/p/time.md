Here at *Baruffio* we sometimes cast a critical eye on *Harry Potter,*
and amuse ourselves by pointing out inconsistencies in the books (then
[weaving them into conspiracy theories](/p/trace "There's no Such
Thing as the Trace")).  But time travel in *Prisoner of Azkaban* is a
model of consistency, illustrating wonderfully how time travel
works---if it's possible at all.

## The past is past

Near the end of the book, Harry and Hermione wake up in the hospital
wing and learn that Sirius Black is about to receive the Dementor's
Kiss, and that it is *too late* to stop it:

> "Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat
> Lady---entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife---without Pettigrew,
> alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius’ sentence."
>
> *"But you believe us."*
>
> "Yes, I do," said Dumbledore quietly. "But I have no power to make
> other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister for Magic ..."
>
> Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground
> beneath him was falling sharply away.  He had grown used to the idea
> that Dumbledore could solve anything.  He had expected Dumbledore to
> pull some amazing solution out of the air.  But no ... their last
> hope was gone.
>
> "What we need," said Dumbledore slowly, and his light-blue eyes
> moved from Harry to Hermione, "is more *time."*
>
> "But---" Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. "OH!"
>
> "Now, pay attention," said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
> clearly.  "Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the
> seventh floor.  Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower.
> If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one innocent
> life tonight.  But remember this, both of you. *You must not be
> seen.* Miss Granger, you know the law---you know what is at stake
> ... *you – must – not – be – seen”* (Chapter 21).


But there's no time for grief.  Sirius Black, in the form of a dog,
attacks Ron and drags him underneath the Whomping Willow.  Harry and
Hermione follow, and just after sunset they find themselves in the
Shrieking Shack.

You all know what happens next.  Remus Lupin arrives, then Snape.
Snape is stunned, Scabbers is unmasked as Peter Pettigrew, and his
guilt (and Sirius' innocence) is established.  The whole party finally
exits the Whomping Willow to take Pettigrew up to Hogwarts.

But the full moon is out.  Lupin transforms into a werewolf, Pettigrew
escapes, and Harry, Hermione, and Sirius are surrounded by Dementors
and fall unconscious, but not before Harry sees *someone* cast a
Patronus from across the lake.  When Harry and Hermione wake up in the
hospital wing, Sirius is locked in a room upstairs and Cornelius Fudge
has ordered that he recieve the Dementor's Kiss.

> "What we need," said Dumbledore slowly, and his light-blue eyes
> moved from Harry to Hermione, "is more time."
>
> "But---" Hermione began.  And then her eyes became very round. "OH!"

And so they go back in time to rescue Buckbeak and Sirius.




Then, while waiting for the right moment to rescue Sirius, Harry sees
his past self under attack by Dementors.  *He* casts the Patronus that
drives away the Dementors and rescues Sirius, Hermione, and himself.

The details of what happens next don't matter here.  We're supposed to
be talking about time travel anyway, and we've got enough context to
do that now.

## "You must not be seen"

What's most interesting about Harry and Hermione's journey back in
time is that *they don't actually change the past.* When Hermione
spins the Time-Turner to send her and Harry back three hours, they've
already saved Buckbeak.  See how it's left deliberately ambiguous the
first time around, when Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Scabbers leave
Hagrid's hut just before the execution is supposed to occur---at
sunset:

> The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the
> sounds drifting from Hagrid's garden. There was a jumble of
> indistinct male voices, a silence and then, without warning, the
> unmistakeable swish and thud of an axe.
>
> Hermione swayed on the spot.
>
> "They did it!" she whispered to Harry. "I d-don’t believe it---they
> did it!"
>
> Harry's mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood
> transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last
> rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the
> long-shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.
>
> "Hagrid," Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing,
> he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms
> (Chapters 16--17).

They don't see Buckbeak get killed.  They don't hear Hagrid mourning.
And for good reason, because Buckbeak *didn't* get killed, and Hagrid
isn't howling with sorrow.  When Harry and Hermione go back in time,
the first thing they do is rescue Buckbeak from the Ministry
executioner.  While Hagrid, Dumbledore, a Ministry committee member,
and the executioner McNair are in Hagrid's hut, Harry unties Buckbeak
and leads him away.

> Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione and
> Buckbeak stood quite still; even the Hippogriff seemed to be
> listening intently.
>
> Silence ... then---
>
> "Where is it?" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. "Where
> is the beast?"
>
> "It was tied here!" said the executioner furiously. "I saw it! Just
> here!"
>
> "How extraordinary," said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement
> in his voice.
>
> "Beaky!" said Hagrid huskily.
>
> There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner

> "Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself
> free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!" (Chapter 21, my emphasis)

Buckbeak had been rescued the whole time.  Harry and Hermione just had
to do it.

It might be easier to get this idea if we look at Harry's Patronus.
After he, Hermione, Ron, Sirius, Lupin, Snape, and Pettigrew leave the
Shrieking Shack, the full moon comes out and Lupin transforms into a
werefolf.  Pettigrew escapes, and everyone is scattered across the
grounds.  Harry, Hermione, and Sirius find themselves at the edge of
the lake, surrounded by Dementors.  Sirius and Hermione faint, and
just before Harry's soul is sucked from his body, something miraculous
happens:

> Something was driving the Dementors back ... it was circling around
> him and Sirius and Hermione ... the rattling, sucking sounds of the
> Dementors were fading. They were leaving ... the air was warm again
> ...
>
> With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head
> a few inches and saw an animal amidst the light, galloping away
> across the lake. Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out
> what it was ... it was bright as a unicorn.  Fighting to stay
> conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the
> opposite shore.  For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness,
> somebody welcoming it back ... raising his hand to pat it
> ... someone who looked strangely familiar ... but it couldn’t be
> ... (Chapter 20)

At first Harry thinks it's his father who saves him, but it isn't, and
never was.  He saves himself from the Dementors:

> Harry raised his head to look at the circle of Dementors across the
> lake.  One of them was lowering its hood.  It was time for the
> rescuer to appear---but no one was coming to help this time---
>
> And then it hit him---he understood. He hadn’t seen his father---he
> had seen *himself*---
>
> Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his
> wand.
>
> "EXPECTO PATRONUM!" he yelled (Chapter 21).

When Harry does this, he *isn't* changing the past.  He's just getting
around to doing what he already did:

> "Harry, I can't believe it---you conjured up a Patronus that drove
> away all those Dementors! That’s very, *very* advanced magic ..."
>
> "I knew I could do it this time," said Harry, "because I'd already
> done it ... Does that make sense?"
