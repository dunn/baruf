Here at *Baruffio* we sometimes cast a critical eye on *Harry Potter,*
and amuse ourselves by pointing out inconsistencies in the books (then
[weaving them into conspiracy theories](/p/trace "There's no Such
Thing as the Trace")).  But time travel in *Prisoner of Azkaban* is a
model of consistency, illustrating wonderfully how time travel
works---if it's possible at all.

Just so everyone's on the same page, let's review the events that lead
up to this conversation.  Hermione finds Scabbers the rat in Hagrid's
cabin, and she, Harry, Ron, and Scabbers leave *before* the execution
of Buckbeat the Hippogriff is scheduled to take place---at sunset.
But they can't help but hear what happens:

> The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the

But there's no time for grief.  Sirius Black, in the form of a dog,
attacks Ron and drags him underneath the Whomping Willow.  Harry and
Hermione follow, and just after sunset they find themselves in the
Shrieking Shack.

You all know what happens next.  Remus Lupin arrives, then Snape.
Snape is stunned, Scabbers is unmasked as Peter Pettigrew, and his
guilt (and Sirius' innocence) is established.  The whole party finally
exits the Whomping Willow to take Pettigrew up to Hogwarts.

But the full moon is out.  Lupin transforms into a werewolf, Pettigrew
escapes, and Harry, Hermione, and Sirius are surrounded by Dementors
and fall unconscious, but not before Harry sees *someone* cast a
Patronus from across the lake.  When Harry and Hermione wake up in the
hospital wing, Sirius is locked in a room upstairs and Cornelius Fudge
has ordered that he recieve the Dementor's Kiss.

Then Dumbledore speaks with Harry and Hermione:

> *"Listen to me, Harry.* It is too late, you understand me? You must

> "He hates Sirius," Hermione said desperately. "All because of some

> "Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat

>
> *"But you believe us."*
>
> "Yes, I do," said Dumbledore quietly. "But I have no power to make

> "What we need," said Dumbledore slowly, and his light-blue eyes

> "But---" Hermione began.  And then her eyes became very round. "OH!"

And so they go back in time.  Harry and Hermione first rescue Buckbeak
from the Ministry executioner.  While Hagrid, Dumbledore, a Ministry
committee member, and the executioner McNair are in Hagrid's hut,
Harry unties Buckbeak and leads him away.

> Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione and

Then, while waiting for the right moment to rescue Sirius, Harry sees
his past self under attack by Dementors.  *He* casts the Patronus that
drives away the Dementors and rescues Sirius, Hermione, and himself.

The details of what happens next don't matter here.  We're supposed to
be talking about time travel anyway, and we've got enough context to
do that now.

## "You must not be seen"

What's most interesting about Harry and Hermione's journey back in
time is that *they don't actually change the past.* When Hermione
spins the Time-Turner to send her and Harry back three hours, they've
already saved Buckbeak.  They've already rescued Sirius.  Harry has
already successfully cast the Patronus Charm.

When Hermione spins the Time-Turner, it's already been done.  They
just need to do it.
