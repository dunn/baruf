}

Until *Deathly Hallows*, we all thought *Expelliarmus* was just a
nifty spell that causes people to drop their wands and sometimes
knocks them over (which is why we had all those Tower Truthers saying
that [Dumbledore wasn't
dead](http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/dumbledore-clues.html "Beyond Hogwarts")).
But then it turns out that it's *totally bonkers*. Apparently
disarming someone actually *transfers their wand's loyalty to you*.

This is totally bonkers because *everybody disarms everybody* at some
point.  So to figure out whose wand is whose and what *really*
happened, let's catalog every instance of disarming ever!

Before we do that, though, we need to figure out when exactly a wand
changes owners.

Well, maybe not *exactly.*

## How *Expelliarmus* works (maybe)

For some reason Harry has to finish He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the
*very same way* that he beats You-Know-Who when he's only a baby;
namely, by having Lord Thingy's *Avada Kedavra* bounce off the Chosen
Boy like he's some sort of magic mirror. In order to pull it off,
Rowling drops this tidbit on us two-thirds of the way through
*Deathly Hallows*:

> "Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably
> springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy."
>
> "Was?" repeated Harry. "Isn't it still his?"
>
> "Perhaps not. If you took it---"
>
> "---I did---"
>
> "---then it may be yours.  Of course, the manner of taking matters."
>
> ...
>
> "I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force," said Harry.  "Can I
> use it safely?"
>
> "I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered
> wand will usually bend its will to its new master" (*DH,* chapter
> 24).

If you're prone to fits of charitability, you might think that all
this means is that, when you disarm someone else by force and take
their wand, *eventually* the wand *might* "bend its will" to you.

But you would be wrong! Check out this exchange from Harry's rap
battle with Voldy:

> "You still don't get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn't
> enough!  Holding it, using it, doesn't make it really yours.  Didn't

> Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore died, someone
> who never even laid a hand on it.  The new master removed the wand

> Potter, it makes no difference to you and me.  You no longer have

>
> "But you're too late," said Harry.  "You've missed your chance.  I
> got there first.  I overpowered Draco weeks ago.  I took this wand
> from him."
>
> Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone
> in the Hall upon it.
>
> "So it all comes down to this, doesn't it?" whispered Harry.  "Does
> the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed?  Because if
> it does ... I am the true master of the Elder Wand" (*DH,* chapter
> 36).

You don't even have to *touch* a wand to win it. And not only that,
when you disarm someone *you get all the wands* ***they've*** *won*.
That's how Harry gets the Elder Wand by disarming Draco, even though
it's tucked away in Dumbledore's tomb.

But at least you do have to disarm the other person *by force*, like
Ollivander says, right?  WRONG AGAIN:

> And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little
> Gregorovitch's wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst
> into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated
> what looked like a workshop; wood-shavings and gold gleamed in the
> swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched,
> like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair.  In the split
> second that the lantern's light illuminated him, Harry saw the
> delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning
> Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backwards out of the window
> with a crow of laughter (*DH,* chapter 14).

Grindelwald wins the Elder Wand by just sneaking into Gregorovitch's
bedroom and nicking it.

Now, we could get into fussy debates over *intention*, and *malice*,
and try to lay down some criteria for when nabbing someone else's
wand *really counts* as "disarming" them and so transfers the
ownership.

But that would be *boring*. Let's just assume that anyone who grabs
someone else's wand or otherwise disarms them gains ownership of
every wand that person owns.

So, which wands belong to who?

## Swaps that happen before Harry starts at Hogwarts

We just saw how Grindelwald steals the Elder wand from Gregorovitch.
Let's write that down:

- **Grindelwald** has Gregorovitch's and his own wands.

- **Gregorovitch** has nothing.

### *DH,* chapter 35

> "I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me.  I delayed
> meeting him until, finally, it would have been too shameful to
> resist any longer.  People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and
> I had to do what I could.
>
> "Well, you know what happened next.  I won the duel. I won the
> wand."

- **Dumbledore** has Grindelwald's, Gregorovitch's and his own wands.

- **Grindelwald** has nothing.  He lost Dumbledore long ago.

### *OotP,* chapter 28

> Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an
> attack: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and
> his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted,
> "*Expelliarmus!*"

Poor Snivellus can never catch a break.

- **James** has Snape's and his own wands.

- **Snape** has nothing. No wand, no dignity (we all saw his undies,
  remember?), no Lily.

### *DH,* chapter 33

> Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air:
> Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and
> his wand had flown out of his hand.
>
> "Don't kill me!"
>
> "That was not my intention."
>
> Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of
> the wind in the branches.  He stood before Snape with his robes
> whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the
> light cast by his wand.

This doesn't sound like an *Expelliarmus*; Dumbledore's too weird for
any normal spells. It's certainly some sort of disarming,
but---woops---James already disarmed Snivellus. Snape doesn't own his
wand anymore.

Here's how things stand going into the first book:

- **James** has Snape's and his own wands.

- **Snape** has nothing.

- **Dumbledore** has Grindelwald's, Gregorovitch's and his own wands.

- **Grindelwald** has nothing.

- **Gregorovitch** has nothing.

## *Philosopher's Stone*

### *PS,* chapter 10

> Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own
> wand---not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the
> first spell that came into his head: "*Wingardium Leviosa!*"
>
> The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up
> into the air, turned slowly over---and dropped, with a sickening
> crack, on to its owner's head.

Because why should we limit this to wands? How very close-minded. The
wand chooses the wizard, but the club chooses the mindless death
machine, too. (Ron is pretty mindless, so the club chose well here.)

- **Ron** has the troll's club and his own wand.

## *Chamber of Secrets*

### *CoS,* chapter 11

> Both of them swung their wands up and over their shoulders. Snape
> cried: "*Expelliarmus!*"  There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light
> and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: he flew backwards off the
> stage, smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the
> floor.

Good for Snivellus, he owns a wand again!

- **Snape** has Lockhart's wand.

- **Lockhart** has nothing but his looks.

### *CoS* chapter 13

> Percy said, "As a school Prefect---", but Harry had lost his temper.
> He pulled out his wand and shouted, "*Expelliarmus!*" and just as
> Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out
> of his hand into the air.  Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.

- **Harry** has his own wand and Draco's books.

- **Draco** is going to have to buy new books.

### *CoS,* chapter 16

> Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,
> when Harry bellowed, "*Expelliarmus!*"  Lockhart was blasted
> backwards, falling over his trunk.  His wand flew high into the air;
> Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.

Dang, Lockhart already lost his wands.  Ron is actually throwing
*Snape's* wand out the window.  **No changes** here.

> "Get up," said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.
>
> Lockhart got to his feet---then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the
> ground.
>
> Harry jumped forward, but too late. Lockhart was straightening up,
> panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his
> face.

Why doesn't Harry just *Expelliarmus* him again here? Possibly
because Harry is pathetic; but who knows, really.

- **Lockhart** has Ron's wand.

- **Ron** has the troll's club.

### *CoS,* chapter 18

> Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny got a compartment to
> themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they
> were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding
> Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster
> Fireworks, and practised disarming each other by magic. Harry was
> getting very good at it.

Well, since we don't know *who* disarms *who* here (THANKS, J.K.),
let's just suppose that, since "Harry was getting very good at it",
he disarmed everyone else.  That makes sense, right?

- **Harry** has Hermione's, Fred's, George's, Ginny's and his own
  wands, and Draco's books.

Let's review the scores:

- **Harry** has Hermione's, Fred's, George's, Ginny's and his own
  wands, and Draco's books.

- **Hermione** has nothing.

- **Fred** has nothing.

- **George** has nothing.

- **Ginny** has nothing.

- **Lockhart** has Ron's wand.

- **Ron** has the troll's club.

- **Harry** has his own wand and Draco's books.

- **Draco** has a library card.

- **Snape** has Lockhart's wand.

- **James** has Snape's and his own wands.

- **Dumbledore** has Grindelwald's, Gregorovitch's and his own wands.

- **Grindelwald** has nothing.

- **Gregorovitch** has nothing.

## *Prisoner of Azkaban*

### *PoA,* chapter 1

> *I couldn't believe it when Dad won the* Daily Prophet *Draw.  Seven
> hundred galleons!  Most of it's gone on this holiday, but they're
> going to buy me a new wand for next year.*

Ron gets a new wand!  Since it probably "chose" him at Ollivander's, I
don't think it knows or cares that Lockhart disarmed him the previous
year.

- **Ron** has his new wand and the troll's club.

- **Lockhart** has Ron's old wand.

### *PoA,* chapter 17

> It was Sirius Black.
>
> "*Expelliarmus!*" he croaked, pointing Ron's wand at them.
>
> Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the
> air, and Black caught them.

Looks like Sirius took Ron's wand by force, then did some badass
double-disarmery.

- **Sirius** has Ron's new wand along with Harry's, Hermione's,
  Fred's, George's, Ginny's and his own wands.

- **Harry** still has Draco's books, I guess.

- **Ron** has the troll's club.

> But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat---

> "No," he hissed. "I've waited too long---"
>
> The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.
>
> Then he saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere.  Black let go of

Ron proves himself not entirely useless!

- **Ron** has Harry's, Hermione's, Fred's, George's, Ginny's and
  Sirius' wands, along with his new wand and the troll's club.

- **Sirius** has nothing.

> "*Expelliarmus!*" Lupin shouted.
>
> Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione
> was holding.

Hermione was holding her and Ron's wands, but she didn't take them by
force from Ron; he still owns them (and Harry's wand), and Lupin
doesn't disarm *him*, so I don't think Lupin wins anything here. He
wins whatever wands are Hermione's and Harry's, which are none.

### *PoA,* chapter 19

> Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take
> even one step towards him, he had raised his wand.
>
> "*Expelliarmus!*" he yelled---except that his wasn't the only voice

>
> Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape
> at exactly the same moment.  Snape's wand soared in a high arc and
> landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.

Shit.  *Exactly* the same moment?

The boring interpretation is that since no one person disarmed Snape,
nobody wins his wands.  But that's not our only option: look where the
wand lands!

- **Crookshanks** has Lockhart's wand.

- **Snape** has nothing.

### *PoA,* chapter 20

> Pettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his
> bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light---and Ron lay
> motionless on the ground.  Another bang---Crookshanks flew into the
> air and back to the earth in a heap.
>
> "*Expelliarmus!*" Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew;
> Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight.

- **Harry** has Pettigrew's wands and Draco's books.

- **Pettigrew** has nothing.

- **Crookshanks** has Lockhart's wand.

- **Snape** has nothing.

- **Ron** has Harry's, Hermione's, Fred's, George's, Ginny's and
  Sirius' wands, along with his new wand and the troll's club.

- **Sirius** has nothing.

- **Hermione** has nothing.

- **Fred** has nothing.

- **George** has nothing.

- **Ginny** has nothing.

- **Lockhart** has Ron's old wand.

- **Draco** has nothing.

- **James** has Snape's and his own wands.

- **Dumbledore** has Grindelwald's, Gregorovitch's and his own wands.

- **Grindelwald** has nothing.

- **Gregorovitch** has nothing.

## *Goblet of Fire*

### *GoF,* chapter 4

> Harry didn't want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon's second
> ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it
> best to leave the situation to Mr Weasley.  He stepped into the
> fire, looking over his shoulder as he said, "The Burrow!"; his last

This year, the Dursleys are going to have a pretty barren Christmas
tree, because ...

- **Mr Weasley** has Uncle Vernon's ornaments.

- **Uncle Vernon** still has an epic mustache, though.

### *GoF,* chapter 35

> I was starting to fight my father's Imperius Curse.  There were
> times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when
> I seemed outside his control.  It happened, there, in the Top Box.
> It was like waking from a deep sleep.  I found myself out in public,

> pocket in front of me.  I had not been allowed a wand since before
> Azkaban.  I stole it.  Winky didn't know.  Winky is frightened of
> heights.  She had her face hidden."

- **Barty Crouch Jr** has Pettigrew's wand.

- **Harry** still has Draco's books, even though he doesn't deserve
  them. He hasn't read anything since Hermione started doing his
  homework for him in the first year.

### *GoF,* chapter 31

> But it was no use---the spider was either so large, or so magical,

>
> "*Expelliarmus!*"
>
> It worked---the Disarming spell made the spider drop him, but that

> which crumpled beneath him.

After disarming the spider, Harry no longer feels alienated from his
own body. He finds that he is more comfortable in his own skin and in
fact has better motor control too. (Now you might say, "Alex, that's
ridiculous."  Yes.  *But how else could he survive the graveyard?*)

### *GoF,* chapter 34

> Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted "*Expelliarmus!*", Voldemort
> cried "*Avada Kedavra!*"
>

Nobody gets disarmed here, we just get some *Priori Incantatem*
nonsense.  So there are **no changes** of wand ownership during this
*geist ex whatthefuck*.

Not enough changes here to do a whole recap of who-owns-what. Let's
move on.

## *Order of the Phoenix*

### *OotP,* chapter 18

> The room was suddenly full of shouts of *Expelliarmus*.  Wands flew

Oh, shit.

> Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his
> hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a

- **Harry** has Neville's wand and Draco's books.

> "*Expelliarmus!*" said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his
> wand fly out of his hand.

- **Neville** has his wand.

- **Harry** has Draco's books.

- **Fred or George** has Zacharias' wand.

- **Ginny** has Michael's wand.

- The **Creeveys** have all the books.

- **Luna** has Justin's and her wands and his hair and his clothes.

- **Zacharias** has nothing.

- **Michael** has nothing.

- **Justin** has nothing.

Maybe Hermione's inexplicable attraction to Ron (the boy so solid he
cannot apparate half an inch across a room and who nobody likes) is
due to the fact that he's always got her wand.

### *OotP,* chapter 32

Here it's Malfoy disarming Harry and Millicent Bulstrode taking
Hermione's wand. (It's always Millicent who gets Hermione. I wonder
if Hermione smells like Millicent's cat because of the Polyjuice
episode and that makes Millicent inexplicably attracted to Hermione.
Huh.)

Anyway, Harry still doesn't own a wand. Too bad Draco didn't relieve
Harry of his homework planner, too; then Draco would get his books
back!

Hermione doesn't have shit either.  **No changes!**

> There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered,

Not only gagged but also, presumably, disarmed.  The tricky thing here
is figuring out who disarmed who.  Warrington is holding Ron and
Crabbe has Neville, so they probably also took their wands, but the
other Slytherins are unnamed.

- **Warrington** has Harry's, Hermione's, Fred's, George's, Ginny's
  and Sirius' wands and Ron's new wand, as well as his own.

- **Crabbe** has Neville's and his wands.

- **Slytherin A** has Michael's wand and her own.

- **Slytherin B** has Justin's and Luna's wands and their own.

- **Ron** has the troll's club.

- **Neville** has nothing.

- **Ginny** has nothing

- **Luna** has Justin's hair and his clothes.

### *OotP,* chapter 33

Ginny probably disarmed Malfoy, but otherwise we don't have much to
help us figure out who disarmed who, or how they got their wands back
from the Slytherins in the first place.

It would be nice to just say that each of our Heroes snatched their
wand from the person holding them---their physical injuries support
this, maybe---but even then, who got Millicent? The person who
disarmed Millicent was whoever cast the Disarming Charm
(*Expelliarmus*, obvs), so it likely wasn't Neville or Ginny. Given
Luna's relative ineptitude with the spell, there's a fair chance it
wasn't her. So let's say Ron disarmed Millicent.

- **Ginny** has Michael's wand and some Slytherin's wand.

- **Ron** has Harry's, Hermione's, Fred's, George's, Ginny's,
  Sirius', Millicent's and Warrington's wands, along with his own new
  wand and the troll's club. (Dang. For someone so useless Ron sure
  is useful.)

- **Neville** has Crabbe's and his own wands.

- **Luna** has Justin's wand and some Slytherin's wand and her own, as
  well as Justin's hair and clothing.

- **Hermione** has nothing.

- **Warrington** has nothing.

- **Millicent** has nothing.

- **Crabbe** has nothing.

- **Slytherin A** has nothing.

- **Slytherin B** has nothing.

### *OotP,* chapter 35

- **Neville** has Crabbe's wand and some Death Eater's wand and his
  own.

This probably counts as a disarming. Neville's wands must have
finally realized how inept he is.

- **Dolohov** has Crabbe's wand and some Death Eater's wand and his
  own (Neville's is destroyed).

- **Neville** has nothing.

- **Ginny** has Michael's wand and some Slytherin's wand.

- **Ron** has Harry's, Hermione's, Fred's, George's, Ginny's,
  Sirius', Millicent's and Warrington's wands, along with his own new
  wand and the troll's club.

- **Luna** has Justin's wand and some Slytherin's wand and her own, as
  well as Justin's hair and clothing.

- **Hermione** has nothing.

- **Warrington** has nothing.

- **Millicent** has nothing.

- **Crabbe** has nothing.

- **Fred or George** has Zacharias' wand.

- The **Creeveys** have all the books.

- **Barty Crouch Jr** has Pettigrew's wand.

- **Harry** has nothing (the Creeveys have all the books).

- **Mr Weasley** has Uncle Vernon's ornaments.

- **Uncle Vernon** has an epic mustache.

- **Crookshanks** has Lockhart's wand.

- **Snape** has nothing.

- **Sirius** has nothing.

- **James** has Snape's and his own wands.

- **Dumbledore** has Grindelwald's, Gregorovitch's and his own wands.

- **Grindelwald** has nothing.

- **Gregorovitch** has nothing.

Oooh, this is the important one.

- **Draco** has Dumbledore's, Grindelwald's, Gregorovitch's, and his
  own wands.

- **Dumbledore** has nothing.

La la la, Harry doesn't have a wand. But here we can at least
appreciate how J.K. uses all caps to great effect.

- **Draco** has Dumbledore's, Grindelwald's, and his own wands.

- **Dumbledore** has nothing.

- **Neville** has his new wand.

I'm not going to repeat everyone's wand ownership status again
because not much changed and this damn thing is getting so long. But
we're almost done!

This is for sure a disarming. But Voldy's using Lucius Malfoy's wand,
so does Harry own that wand now? I don't think so, because Lucius
wasn't really disarmed. He was *coerced* to give Voldemort his wand,
sure, but that probably doesn't count.

- **Harry** has Voldemort's wand.

- **Voldemort** has nothing.

### *DH,* chapter 11

As we learn later, Luna lost her wand when she got pulled off the
Hogwarts Express.  Presumably a Death Eater took it.

- **Some Death Eater** has Justin's and some Slytherin's and Luna's and
  his own wands, as well as Justin's hair and clothing.

- **Luna** has nothing.

Well, crap.  We've got even less to go on here than in Umbridge's
office.  Greyback is the head of this band of Snatchers, so it might
be reasonable to assume that he's just giving orders and not actually
disarming anyone.

We learn a few pages later that Harry was disarmed by Scabior:

> "I know 'e's swollen, ma'am, but it's 'im!" piped up Scabior.  "If
> you look a bit closer, you'll see 'is scar.  And this 'ere, see the

>
> Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinising his swollen face.  Scabior

So I think all we can say is this:

- **Scabior** has Voldemort's wand (hahaha holy shit if he only knew).

- **Snatcher 1** has Mundungus' wand.

- **Snatcher 2** has Ron's, Harry's, Hermione's, Fred's, George's,
  Ginny's, Sirius', and his own wands.

- **Snatcher 3** has Dean's and his own wands (Dean is picked by the
  same group of Snatchers).

- **Harry** has nothing.

- **Hermione** has nothing.

- **Ron** has nothing.

- **Dean** has nothing.

It's really too bad that Greyback didn't disarm Harry et al., instead
of Scabior and the other shitheart Snatchers. Too bad Bellatrix didn't
disarm instead of stun them. Then she would have *everything*. Oh
well; the truth is sacred.

- **Bellatrix** has Greyback's wand and her own.

- **Greyback** has nothing.

Ollivander says this should work, but Barty Crouch Jr. owns Pettigrew's
wand, so Ron's out of luck. **No changes.**

Ronnie the Bear shows his quality!

(Yeah, I know what you're thinking: Harry caught the wand, so are we
sure *he* doesn't own it? Pretty sure. If Filch had caught the Elder
wand as it fell from the tower when Dumbledore was disarmed, would he
have been the true owner of the Elder Wand?)

- **Ron** has Bellatrix's and Greyback's wand.

- **Bellatrix** has nothing.

Well, damn, it looks like J.K. Rowling's wacky scheme might work!
Draco was holding his, Bellatrix's, and Pettigrew's wands.

- **Harry** has Draco's, Dumbledore's, and Grindelwald's wands.

- **Draco** has nothing.

- **Luna** has her new wand.

- **Some Death Eater** has Justin's and some Slytherin's and his own
  wands as well as Luna's old wands, and Justin's hair and clothing.

Draco didn't really own his mother's wand, and he certainly doesn't
own his own, so Crabbe doesn't get anything out of disarming his
boss. But he's about to die, so that's really the least of his
worries.

- **Harry** has Goyle's, Dumbledore's, Grindelwald's and Draco's
  wands.

- **Goyle** has his health, which is more than we can say for
  Crabbe.

### *DH,* chapter 32

Hahahaha, Snape hasn't owned a wand since the last time he was in the
Shrieking Shack, way back in the third book.

This isn't a real disarming. But if we can trust Voldemort, the
ownership of the Wand of Destiny can be transferred through killing:
"The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner"
(*DH* 441). Perhaps this quality is exclusive to the Elder Wand. If
Snape had any non-Elder wands, Voldemort might not have won them here.

But **no changes** occur, because neither of these jerks have wands.

Don't throw Neville's wand away!  It's all you've got!

Looks like Harry is the master of the Elder Wand, after all. But this
whole thing still doesn't make any sense, and Harry really shouldn't
have thrown away the Elder Wand afterward since he doesn't own his
anymore.

Oh well.
