Readers of *SBBS* were introduced to Randi Rabin when we highlighted
her [provocative deconstruction of gender](friends.html "The Case of
the Magical Magnetic Genitals") back in July.  Now, Noozhawk's
J. Edgar Hoover Distinguished Visiting Professor of Feelings is back
in the news with a short but insightful meditation on self-image and
bodily autonomy.  She recounts a question put to her recently by a
female recipient of breast implants,
[who finds that her female friends have become "standoffish"](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/randi_rabin_breasts_lead_way_husband_mail_order_bride_20131024

Is Seeking Mail-Order Bride"):

The superficial reply to these concerns would involve a discussion of
how women can uphold patriarchy by blaming other women for expressing
their sexuality and "tempting" men, and also how women are belittled
for pursuing breast augmentation while simultaneously being
[valued only *for* their breasts](http://www.mrdestructo.com/2013/05/lets-talk-about-angelina-jolies-breasts.html
"Let's Talk About Angelina Jolie's Breasts").  The superficial
recommendations to "Betsy Boob" might include that she refuse to be
ashamed of her body and demand that her "friends" stop blaming her for
the behavior of their husbands.

But that would all be superficial.  It would, in short, be the
recommendation to ***LEAN IN***.  And we know by now that
[leaning in is not the answer to our problems](http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/feminisms-tipping-point-who-wins-from-leaning-in
"Feminism's Tipping Point: Who Wins from Leaning in?").  Professor
Rabin recognizes this, and accordingly recommends that Betsy Boob
instead *lean back*:

> Try having an open discussion with your girlfriends about what is
> going on, and if by chance you are overly friendly with "other
> women's men," you may need to step back a bit---literally.

Randi Rabin understands that, aside from being a slogan for rich white
women that ignores the structural issues that create inequality, the
biggest problem with Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean In" movement was that it
encouraged assertiveness and self-confidence in women.  Rabin sagely
warns that "if you are wearing low cut, extremely revealing outfits
and leading with your 'girls,' rethink what kind of picture you want
to paint here," reminding us that
[feminism is dead](http://m.entrepreneur.com/article/225972 "How
Today's Young Female Entrepreneurs Embrace Their Feminine Mystique")
and that there are certain things that women *must not do*, such as
love themselves unconditionally.
