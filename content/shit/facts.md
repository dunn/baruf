Santa Barbara's a small town, but there's always room for another
pundit.  Indeed, we have quite an enviable concentration of writers
willing to bullshit (in the
[technical sense](http://philosophynow.org/issues/53/On_Bullshit_by_Harry_Frankfurt
"*On Bullshit* by Harry Frankfurt")) in our local publications.  If
Sharon Byrne is our city's Thomas Friedman, putting forth an
[incoherent pragmatism](liberal.html "A New Argument for Moral
Relativism") divorced from truth or morality as a solution to our
political conflicts, then Cheri Rae is our very own David Brooks and
Craig Allen is
[Rob Enderle](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+enderle).

Rae and Allen both have written recent columns that are admirable in
their pursuit of
[truthiness](http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm).  Rae's
column is
[a lovely wistful meditation](http://www.santabarbaraview.com/drive-they-say653663/
"Drive! They Say.") on the necessity of cars.  She mocks the idea that
we should promote alternative modes of transportation with this chunk
of hard data:

> When the 16th birthday dawns, it's finally time to earn the Golden
> Ticket to Freedom and Adulthood: the Driver's License. Some, as my
> own son did, make their appointments for the first moment of the
> first day they can officially take the driving test.  Others, like
> my own daughter wait a year or two, but the idea of not
> driving---ever, or rarely---never enters their minds at all.

> Truth is, driving is high up there on the list of teen essentials,
> along with smartphones, texting and hanging out.  Just take a look
> at the completely packed student parking lots at our local high
> schools---and the fine luxury cars so many kids are driving from
> home to school and all over town.

I could counter with nostalgic anecdotes of my own, telling the unique
life histories of my several friends in their 20s who have yet to get
a license, but I'm bored and I found this by typing "decline in teen
driving" into Google and clicking the first result:

![From a report by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, cited by [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/the-dramatic-30-year-decline-of-young-drivers-in-1-chart/260126/)](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Drivers_Licenses_Sivak_Michigan.PNG)

Let's move on to Craig Allen, who wrote
[an equally ignorant and ahistorical thinkpiece](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/craig_allen_apple_computers_20131027
"Craig Allen: Apple at Risk of Becoming an 'Also-Ran'") on Apple's
prospects.  He starts with a complaint so deep and important that it
has been uttered by every Wordpress blogger since late 2011: that "in
the time since Jobs died, Apple has released numerous evolutionary
products---new versions of the iPhone and iPad, but has not released
any truly new, revolutionary products to rival its current lineup."
This insight derives its force from the scientific principle that
since the three "revolutionary products" usually recognized by
pundits---the iPod, iPhone and iPad---debuted in 2001, 2007, and 2010,
the next revolution should surely have occurred sometime in 2011 or
2012, even though Jobs has only recently ceased to be the subject of
[shitty cartoons set in Heaven](http://maypalo.com/2011/10/09/top-5-best-steve-jobs-in-heaven-comics/).

Allen can be forgiven for overlooking
[the arcane scholastic doctrine of "incrementalism"](http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html
"This is how Apple rolls") that some Medieval theorists believed
better explains Apple's history.  It is a much more complicated thesis
than the one Allen and most of his contemporaries rely on, which is
the single word "INNOVATION" written in 72pt Impact font.

Allen is correct, however, to bemoan the apparently
increasingly-desperate efforts to fool investors into valuing Apple
highly.
[Pitiful revenues last quarter](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/28/5039154/apple-q4-2013-earnings)
and increasingly dismal
[brand recognition](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/business/media/apple-passes-coca-cola-as-most-valuable-brand.html?_r=0)
support his assertion that "Apple's management team must produce real
revenue growth."

He is also correct to compare Apple to another dedicated cellphone
manufacturer that failed when its only product was made obsolete:

> As great as Apple has been, its trajectory is similar to many other
> companies that were once high-fliers and eventually
> tanked. BlackBerry is probably the best example. Not too long ago,
> Blackberry had a cult-like following, so much so that people
> referred to the device as a "crackberry."

The analogy here is very good; neither Apple nor RIM are willing to
[cannibalize their own marketshare by coming out with better stuff](http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/blackberry_vs_iphone)
and then diligently improving it.  Allen's closing statement is
therefore deeply troubling:

> The market is sending a clear signal that Apple is in its twilight
> as a major market leader.

But not for the reason he thinks.
