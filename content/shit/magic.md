[It is an expression we have all heard](http://www.santabarbaraview.com/is-there-a-glass-that-is-neither-half-full-nor-half-empty653636/),
someone is either "a glass half full … or glass half empty" kind of
person. It is a not question of perception, philosophy or sheer
determination to decide how you want to perceive the world.  This is
not an interesting concept either since it's an expression and not a
concept at all.

**I would like to introduce a perception,** which is different than
the expressions and concepts previously introduced on account of it
being a perception and not an expression or a concept.

If you are feeling too negative, and the "glass" is always half empty
for you … pour it out. Literally stop being negative.

Sounds unachievable perhaps, and you might think this article is published on *Santa Barbara Bullshit* for a reason, but I have
a book for you that is way worse.

Our local author, Rhonda Byrne (relation to
[Sharon Byrne](/shit/liberal) unknown) has written several books, The
Magic is one that shifted much of my perception on how to write
grammatically.

While reading The Magic, **I discovered a simple directive.
Gratitude.** Yes, it can be an actual verb, despite being a concept
and not a word at all.

You can do actual scientific experiments with this concept, like
discovering a causal relationship between
[New Age nonsense and cultural appropriation](http://megr.im/post/lucidity).
There is even a science known as Spiritual Physics, assuming that
"science" doesn't mean *science* and "physics" doesn't mean *physics*.

I could end with a quote from Einstein about human stupidity, but ugh
why bother.
