One metaphor that's everywhere these days, or at least close enough to
everywhere to justify a thinkpiece about it, is the metaphor of *war*.
Everyone seems to be comparing war with things that are not war, but
which they are pretty sure are still a lot like war.  Some of these
comparisons are good, maybe, like the description of a widespread
effort to undermine access to life-saving reproductive health
resources as a "War on Women"; others are probably
[bad](http://wonkette.com/490754/catch-1123-being-a-true-and-accurate-account-of-the-late-war-on-christmas
"Wonkette: Catch-11/23: Being A True and Accurate Account of the Late
War On Christmas").

But there's got to be some truth in our favorite longest-running
metaphorical war, right?  If **Culture War** isn't real then all the
weaponized irony we've deployed will have been for nothing and *SBBS*
might as well shut down.  So we're really mad about Jeffrey Moualim's
new piece in the *Independent*, which
[shows some deep disanalogies](http://www.independent.com/news/2014/jan/19/cease-fire-anyone/
"Cease Fire, Anyone?") between actual war and whatever I've been doing
as a foot soldier in the "U.S. Right-Left Culture War".

> Even with the incredibly fierce fighting that transpired for most of

My initial reaction was that I *can* identify with this, since I
sometimes have to stop making fun of bronies because they have Magic
cards I want to trade for.

But then Mr. Moualim describes the "Culture War" in similarly
militaristic terms and takes the comparison to its logical and absurd
conclusion, threatening our business for no better reason than to
establish an important truth:

> Today there is a war waged every day, a culture war between the left

> of every kind to blitzkrieg the opposition, and those left standing
> are entranced with the idea "we live to fight again." The notion of

> right and left of this country will do battle, and hostilities do
> not stop even for the most important and significant day of the year
> during which believers espouse peace on earth, good will toward

> "enemy" and provoke a response filled with hate and hysteria. And
> while it may seem to some just harmless fencing, it has in point of

> intolerance are fortified instead of torn down.

As much as it pains me to admit this, I believe Mr. Moualim is correct
in the conclusions he draws from this juxtaposition, which are
definitely these conclusions and not other conclusions:

1. Wars might be sometimes fought for reasons other than the immediate
   interests of those actually fighting in them.  The soldiers who did
   that illicit fraternizing in no-man's-land on Christmas 1914 didn't
   really have reasons to hate those on the other side, except when
   this one German guy cheated during a game of Magic.  But the
   higher-level officers were pretty ticked off about this because
   their interests were closer aligned with the state.  The foot
   soldiers and their "recognition of each other's humanity" were
   fucking up the game-plan.

    As our good Mr. Moualim makes clear, though, the "issues" commonly
    associated with the "Culture War"---the rights of women, people of
    color, and sexual, gender, and romantic minorities; gun control
    and justice system reform; climate change and other aspects of
    environmental justice---are not abstract concerns that matter only
    to guys like Hitler.  They directly concern the lives of our
    friends and families (it's a bit of a hassle) and those who oppose
    us---who will actually work to prevent free reproductive care for
    all, or the end of the drug war---are threatening our interests
    profoundly.  They're trying to cheat at a *lot* of games of Magic,
    and they won't recognize the humanity of all of us.  Effed up.

2. The second point that Mr. Moualim definitely makes at some point in
his essay, I mean unless I *really* misread it, is that the
*objectives* of the "Culture War" aren't that much like the objectives
of a real war at all.  If there are any overarching goals shared
between all the ongoing struggles on behalf of marginalized people,
one is probably to secure the universal recognition of their
humanity---to make a Christmas Armistice *possible* between more than
just white men from different European countries.

    And an armistice was not probably the point of the Great War, or
    of any war, and anyway if all you want is an armistice you
    probably want fewer soldiers rather than more of them.

So Jeffrey Moualim answers the rhetorical question in his article's
title: it makes no sense to call for a cease-fire, for an armistice,
in the "Culture War", not only because it's not a real war but
because, when we do get a cease-fire, it means we've *won*.
