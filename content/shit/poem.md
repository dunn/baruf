*Welcome to another installment of* Art Critic,
*in which we attempt a negative definition of art by excluding
everything in Santa Barbara.*
 
***

The *Independent* has a proud tradition of publishing
[unusual poetry](http://www.independent.com/news/clickety-clack/
"Clickety-Clack, We Talk Back"), and today saw the continuation of
that saga with a
[rhythmic meditation on "Electronic Devices"](http://www.independent.com/news/2013/sep/09/electronic-devices/
"Electronic Devices").  To attempt to perform a close reading of such
a work would be folly, as Gandalf reminds us: "he that breaks a thing
to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom."

So instead we will respond with verses of our own.

Bad poetry's a crying shame ---

But who's at fault --- what to blame?

Look at all these awful verses

None of them with any purpose

I hate all this tech and I won't tell you why

(It gives me a chance to be published online).

Now my rhythm gets bad, and I leave out a comma,

The editor's sad;

Reading my poem, line by line

Drowning her horror and sorrow in wine.

You can't do this with print media, my friend.

I'm so pleased with this new drivel-publishing trend.
