Dear Jed A. Hendrickson, CM, AICA: Thank you for
[saving us](http://www.santabarbaraview.com/saved-from-the-scourge-of-plastic-bags452524542/
"Saved from the Scourge of Plastic Bags") from the scourge of going
another week without something to make fun of in Santa Barbara (please
do not read with any sarcasm, we're absolutely sincere and in fact
have never been sarcastic ever).

Perhaps now we can try to do something useful for the citizens and
businesses in Santa Barbara---by laughing at your
[letter to the editor](http://www.santabarbaraview.com/saved-from-the-scourge-of-plastic-bags452524542/
"Saved from the Scourge of Plastic Bags").

I have attached a photo of the "attached" photos that you included
with your letter.  The fact that a web-only publication can fail, in
2013, to correctly embed images in a blog post paints a sad picture of
what is allowed to happen when the *Santa Barbara View* is allowed to
operate without regard to the impact on the community.  I realize that
using a PDF to display images is hardly a big deal except it seems to
happen every day (unlike the presence of homeless individuals around
Jed's business, given the gaps in his photographic record).

If it were not for us at *Santa Barbara Bullshit* I fear the City
would take the *View* seriously.

I ask the City Council to do more to marginalize the
[privileged and hateful](home.html "Point-Counterpoint: Kill the
Homeless, or Just Treat Them Like Animals?") members of the local
community in the Milpas Street area.
[Sharon Byrne in particular](liberal.html "A New Argument for Moral Relativism")
should be held to a strict standard (only one article or letter per
month); police budgets should be slashed to reduce the victimization
of the oppressed for the comfort of the rich; and finally the City
needs to recognize the burden it carries as a government complicit in
the continued production of conditions that create homelessness.
