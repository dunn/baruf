Classes begin again next week at UCSB (you can be sure that
[The Daily Nonsense](http://baruffio.com/dn) will too), and nothing
says "Back to School" like a local
[screaming "Go Back Home!"](http://www.noozhawk.com/article/letter_to_the_editor_foreign_students_should_learn_rules_of_the_road_201309
"Letter to the Editor: Foreign Students Should Learn Rules of the
Road") at international students:

> Annually, we are flooded with enormous numbers of foreign students.
> I feel it is the schools' responsibility to educate and quiz the
> students on local rules that can save their lives---and
> ours---making sure they fully comprehend laws, rules and common

American children never use their parents' money to buy expensive
things and wreck them.  Granted, that may be only due to Obama's war
on the rich (against which only a few brave souls are
[standing strong](http://www.forbes.com/sites/harrybinswanger/2013/09/17/give-back-yes-its-time-for-the-99-to-give-back-to-the-1/
"Harry Binswanger: Give Back? Yes, It's Time For The 99% To Give Back
To The 1%")), but the point stands.  Believing oneself to be above the
law due to a childhood marinated in wealth is a condition exclusive to
foreigners, particularly young Asian students.  The PC police don't
want you to hear this, but Deborah Barnes has exemplified a
characteristic American bravery by telling the truth nonetheless.
